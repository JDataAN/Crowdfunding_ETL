# Level Up Your Data Skills: Crowdfunding ETL (Project 2)

### This project dives into the world of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) for crowdfunding data. We'll build a powerful database in PostgreSQL to store campaign information and utilize QuickDBD to show a visualization of our data.

# The Objective:

Create a solid database schema (think blueprint) named crowdfunding_db_schema.sql in PostgreSQL. Define tables for campaigns, contacts, categories, and subcategories to streamline data organization and accessibility.

# Data Breakdown:

## Project Files:

* crowdfunding_db_schema.sql: This script defines the structure of our database, including tables, columns, and how they all connect.
* crowdfunding_db.pdf: We visualized our database layout using QuickDBD, gaining insights into how data flows and relationships are structured.

## CSV Files:

* campaign.csv: This file holds all the juicy details about our crowdfunding campaigns.
* contacts.csv: Here you'll find contact information for everyone involved.
* category.csv & subcategory.csv: These files categorize the campaigns, helping you understand their focus.
  
# Database Setup:

* PostgreSQL Ready? Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running smoothly.
* Create the Database: Name your new database crowdfunding_db.
* Building the Foundation: Run the crowdfunding_db_schema.sql script in your PostgreSQL database. This creates the tables and establishes their relationships.
* Data Population: Now, let's fill your database! Use PostgreSQL's \copy command (or an SQL client) to import data from the CSV files into their corresponding tables.

## Bonus Info:

This project leverages PostgreSQL for data management, Git for version control, and QuickDBD for insightful schema visualization.
